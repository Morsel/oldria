My favorite cooking book by Ruhlman is Ratio. The app is so useful, I use
it almost every day in my home life and restaurants.  I'm also a big fan of
House: A memoir. It's full of great stories and really makes me appreciate
living in a century home. I'd have to say that he has had a tremendous
influence on my career in the best possible way.
