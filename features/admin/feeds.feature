@feeds
Feature: Feeds
  In order to have users use SpoonFeed as an easy news source
  As an admin
  I want to provide an RSS URL for a feed, override the default title provided by the feed, select some feeds as "default on" for users, so that users who haven't set preferences will have these on, and set order of the feeds


  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an admin
