My favorite cooking book by Ruhlman is Ratio. The app is so useful, I use\r\nit almost every day in my home life and restaurants.  I'm also a big fan of\r\nHouse: A memoir. It's full of great stories and really makes me appreciate\r\nliving in a century home. I'd have to say that he has had a tremendous\r\ninfluence on my career in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Apr 10, 2012 at 7:31 AM, Jonathon Sawyer <\r\njonathon.sawyer@thegreenhousetavern.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> My favorite cooking book by Ruhlman is Ratio.
