        You've all heard that today's news is tomorrow's bird-cage liner. 
        We'd like to add that the conventional press kit is garbage before it's even sent out the door. 
        Press kits aren't searchable, they aren't complete, and, there's no way to update the information once it is out the door. 
        We think a restaurant deserves better.
