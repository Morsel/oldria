My Mom was a fearless and adventuresome cook but it was my Dad who got me into the kitchen. When I  was 8 Dad started a subscription to Gourmet magazine. Most of the recipes were a little strange for 1964 in Indianapolis Indiana but Dad and I loved reading the travel articles and we would pore over the recipes wondering where we would find the exotic ingredients. Dad and I made Caesar salad together at least once a month. I would toss while he squeezed the lemon and showed me how to perfectly coddle an egg. Dad manned the grill in the summer but that was about it as far as cooking went. It was his enthusiasm and unabashed enjoyment of eating that was his specialty. He showed me the connection between cooking and love-something I hold very dear.

Hi Susan, 

  <http://spoonfeed.restaurantintelligenceagency.com/images/bubble_large.png?et_id=a1eld1> Did any of the men in your family cook when you were growing up? If so, did they have a specialty?
