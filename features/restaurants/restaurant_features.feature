  In order to Associate tags to a restaurant
  As a restaurant manager

    Given I am logged in as an admin
    And a restaurant named "Piece"
    And that "Piece" has a premium account
    And the following restaurant features:
      | page    | category      | value    |
      | Cuisine | Cuisine Style | Casual   |

  # Scenario: Initial navigation
  #   When I go to the restaurant show page for "Piece"
  #   And I follow "Edit restaurant"
