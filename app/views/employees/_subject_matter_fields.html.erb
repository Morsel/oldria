<p>We want to make sure that the right media inquiries go to the right people at your restaurant. What kinds of topics are you comfortable having <%= @employee ? @employee.name : 'this employee' %> respond to? Keep in mind, their responses will represent <%= @restaurant ? @restaurant.name : 'this restaurant'%> and go straight to the media. So, it is important to choose wisely!</p>

<p class="highlightable"><strong>Note:</strong> Spoonfeed Account Administrators receive <strong>all</strong> media requests and RIA messages, regardless of the subject matters chosen below.</p>
