I'm going to fight every urge to rant here and simply state:  being southern born and raised, this is embarrassing to the music and food industry. I'm sure they'll make millions.

    Hi Aaron,



      



  Rather than release a new album, Lynyrd Skynyrd decided to release a new restaurant. Coming soon to the Vegas strip is Lynyrd Skynyrd BBQ & Beer at the Excalibur. Packed with musical memorabilia, the restaurant will feature Texas-style BBQ and Jacksonville-inspired decor, in honor of the band's origins. Of course, it will also have a small concert stage for cover bands and the band itself on occasion. Which musician or band would you most like to see open a restaurant? What would it serve and what would it be called?
