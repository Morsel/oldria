Spoonfeed understands that food media is no longer one person shouting from a mountaintop, but conversations on the same level. No longer are chefs anonymous cooks in toques, but someone we can now engage in dialogue easily. And that's indispensable for journalists. No hyperbole. I spent 20 mins reading up on a chef and my interview questions to him were 10 times better because of it.
