Feature: Soapbox pages

  Scenario: Viewing the site's about page
  Given I am logged in as an admin
  When I create a new soapbox page with:
    | Title                       | About Soapbox             |
    | Slug                        | about                     |
    | soapbox_page_content_editor | This page explains a lot. |
  And I go to "soapbox/about"
  Then I should see "About Soapbox"
