    And a restaurant named "Bourgeois Pig"

    And the user "normal" is employed by "Piece"
    And the user "normal" is an account manager for "Bourgeois Pig"
    And the date and time is "now"

    And I attach the file "/features/images/menu1.pdf" to "menu_pdf_remote_attachment_attributes_attachment" on S3
    And I press "Upload"
    Then I should see a menu with the name "January" and change frequency "Monthly" and uploaded at date "now"
    Then I should see a link to download the uploaded menu pdf "menu1.pdf"
